# Schnoodle Book

Something I made 2 years ago when reddit was easy to scrape. Managed to get it working one last time ~April 2023. Since then I didn't bother. All the code is in `main - obsolete.py`, for whoever wants to adapt this, the license is permissive, see top of the file.

This is >6000 posts gathered and processed. The raw data may not be available in full, as sometimes posts on reddit/imgur get deleted. It's ~20GBs, I can upload it if someone really really wants it. This repo contains only the processed data, which is around 3GBs.

Due to its size it is advised that you clone the repo and use it locally.

The layout is made such that it should be possible to print (target quality is 300dpi) or export to PDF. However I was never able to get it to render correctly as PDF. See `to_pdf.py`.

Hopefully I won't get an angry email from github, I'm pushing the limits a little bit here. In that happens I might redo it with more compressed images.
